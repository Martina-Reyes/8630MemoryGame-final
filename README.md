# Memory Game

What began as a simple memory game for kids 4+ age with no ads, no complicated screens, and a straightforward design has been upgraded to remove all hard-coded strings so that the game can be more easily localized and adapted to add games that would be more appropriate for target cultures.

### Features

- 3 built-in themes : `Animals` :cat2: `Monsters` :octopus: & `Emojis` :smile:  
- 6 types of difficulties :star2:
- Sounds on winning :musical_note:

Please do not merge this code back into the original memory game, it was upgraded and is no longer compatible with the original game.
